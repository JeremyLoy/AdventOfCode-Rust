# advent_of_code_rust

A monorepo containing solutions for various years written in Rust.

This is a learning exercise for me, so not all code will be idiomatic, and not all problems will be attempted or have solutions.

This year, I will be using ChatGPT (through Jetbrains AI Assistant) to learn Rust and its idioms. I will _not_ be using it to actually solve the problems.

## Scaffolding

```shell
cargo run -- [year] [day] [session] [end]
cargo run --bin scaffold [year] [day] [session] [end]
```
